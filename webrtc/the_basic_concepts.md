# WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)

WebRTC is a free, open source project that provides web browsers and mobile aplications with real-time communications (RTC) via APIS.
It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps.

WebRTC is being standardized through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

## Access

The WebRTC allows to access mic, cam, screen share and other devices.
It can be shared on streams using peer-to-peer.

## Challenges

The browser don't know what's your ip. To create the channel with other machine, you will need a STUN SERVER that returns your ip. With that you can request to other machine or others and they will permit to relashionship to share audio, videos and files in real-time communication.
